HOW TO INSTALL WRITER'S BLOCK

1) Extract the contents of this .zip file, being sure to maintain the directory
   structure. You can do this by using the Extract function instead of dragging the
   files out of the .zip.

2) Open admin/control.php with a plain-text editor like Notepad or BBedit and put your
   mySQL login details where required. You can rename the tables that Writer's Block
   will use, but it is not necessary if you're only running one copy. There are also
   other configuration options in control.php that you may wish to change.

3) Upload all files except for this one to the public directory of your site (usually
   this is where your FTP client puts you upon connection).

4) Run install.php. Fill all the form fields. Delete install.php when it is finished.

5) That's it. Log into the admin section with your username and password and start
   using Writer's Block.

Please read the manual at http://www.desiquintans.com/writersblock/manual/index.php.
It explains a lot of things that are not explained in Writer's Block itself.

You may notice that the default template looks like poo. Get creative!
